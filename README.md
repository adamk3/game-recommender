# Steam Game Recommender

Welcome to the Steam Game Recommender project! This application recommends Steam games based on user preferences. Data is collected from public profiles using the Steam Web API. The recommendation engine is powered by Python, NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter, and Flask. This project was made to learn the fundamentals of content-based recommender systems and to learn more about data parsing using python.

## Features

- Personalized game recommendations based on user interaction history.
- User-friendly web interface using Flask.
- Implementation of content-based filtering (and maybe hybrid filtering) for improved accuracy.
